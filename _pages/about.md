Hey there! My name is Jules Collenne, and I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Artificial Intelligence 🖥️ Applied to Medicine 🩺. My research focuses on computer-aided diagnosis, interpretability of machine learning models, and, in a more general and theoretical manner, unsupervised visual representation learning.
