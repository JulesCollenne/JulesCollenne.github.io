# Hi everyone!

I've been working on it for some time, and while it's not much... I'd say it's honest work (got it ? 👀️)

LLMs are already entering our daily life more and more and I'd say it will continue until it becomes completely natural to have AI assistant a bit everywhere in our daily lives. Whether it's a good thing or not is a question that surpasses me, as much as the ineluctable pursuit of new technologies in our world.

Yet, if I can help people do nice and simple things with it, I'd be glad to be part of it, so my small ebook is a kind of introduction to making your own chatbot linked to your files. You can give it pdf, texts, and it will use it to answer questions.

The first part of the book is free and helps you building your first chatbot into the command line, and then the paid version gives you tools to make your fully functionnal chatbot as a web widget, you know, the small chat bubbles like the ones every website have right now.

If you have some time, don't hesitate to take a look!
