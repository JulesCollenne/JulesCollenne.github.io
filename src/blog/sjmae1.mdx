# What are Self-Supervised Vision Foundation Models?

Depending on where you're coming from, you might think I'm just throwing together random buzzwords, hoping nobody notices that I don’t know what I’m talking about. And you’d almost be right!  
But I *do* know a little about this field, and about the work we did with SJ-MAE... so here’s a breakdown of what these words actually mean, and how they connect, in order to introduce you to our work.

  🧠 <b>TL;DR</b> - Machine learning models differ mainly by how they learn:
  <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
    <li><i>Supervised</i>: learns from human labels</li>
    <li><i>Reinforcement</i>: learns from rewards</li>
    <li><i>Self-supervised</i>: learns from data itself</li>
  </ul>
  Foundation Models use these ideas to build general representations that can transfer to any vision task.

## Supervision in Machine Learning

There are different ways to train neural networks: **supervised**, **self-supervised**, **reinforcement**, and **unsupervised**.  
Each of these methods depends on how we tell the model whether it’s right or wrong for each batch (a set of input instances).  
In the case of images, the model processes multiple samples at once (a *batch*) and outputs predictions.

### Supervised learning

If we were doing classification, for each image in the batch we would tell the model:  
“This image is a dog, you said cat... adjust your parameters!”  
or  
“This image is a cat, and you said it was a cat... good job, keep it that way!”

In this setup, we provide the model with the *ground truth*, because we know the correct answer for each image.  
The training loss (Cross-Entropy Loss) is relatively easy to understand:

![Cross-Entropy Loss](/blog/sjmae/cross_entropy.png)

Here:
- `x` is the **input image** (for example, a picture of a cat 🐱).  
- `y` is the **true label** — the index of the correct class ("cat").  
- `z_j` represents the **logit** predicted by the model for class *j*.  
- The **softmax** function converts logits into probabilities `p_j`, ensuring all classes sum to 1.  
- The **loss** penalizes the model when the predicted probability `p_y` for the correct class is low.

Intuitively, the model is rewarded for assigning **high probability** to the true class and **low probability** to all others.  
As training progresses, minimizing this loss aligns the classifier’s confidence with the ground truth.

### Unsupervised and Self-Supervised Learning

When we don’t have labels or ground truth, we need to find other ways to train the model without giving it the direct answer.  
We’ll see later which types of loss functions are used in these cases.

**Reinforcement learning** stands somewhere between supervised and unsupervised learning: it uses *rewards* from an environment to guide the model toward better decisions.

Here, we’ll focus on **unsupervised methods**.  
Self-supervised learning (SSL) is actually a *specialized form* of unsupervised learning that uses information already contained within the data itself... the image!

It might sound strange that the “label” comes from the image itself, but it’ll make perfect sense once we dive into how these models are trained.

Before that, here’s a simple table of the main paradigms, organized from least to most supervised:

# Foundation Models

Now, let’s talk about **Foundation Models** (FMs).

## A Bit of Background

Machine learning models used to be mostly supervised, focusing on one specific goal: detecting objects, generating images, classifying images, and so on.

Over time, researchers realized that large models trained on massive datasets could dramatically speed up learning for other tasks.  
**ImageNet**, for example, is a dataset containing over a million labeled images. When models are trained on ImageNet, they don’t just learn to classify its categories, they also develop a general understanding of shapes, textures, and structures that transfer well to almost any vision task.

This led to the idea of **transfer learning**: instead of training a model from scratch for each new problem, we can fine-tune a pre-trained model on our dataset and achieve strong performance in only a few epochs, compared to hundreds otherwise.

Thus, **Foundation Models** emerged as the idea of creating models that learn deep and generalizable visual representations, serving as the *foundation* for all other vision tasks.

## How Can These Models Learn General Representations?

Relying solely on classification can be limiting in terms of representation quality.  
Some tasks require richer, more semantic features than those obtained from standard supervised learning.

This limitation, combined with the enormous amount of **unlabeled images** available online, motivated the design of new architectures capable of leveraging this unlabeled data to train stronger Foundation Models.

That’s how **Self-Supervised Vision Foundation Models** appeared in research: their goal is to use the vast amount of unlabelled data on the internet to build models that can encode any image into a powerful, reusable representation.

In the next post, we'll see how these self-supervised FM learn representations from images only!

Stay tuned!
