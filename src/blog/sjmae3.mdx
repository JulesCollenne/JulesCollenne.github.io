Architecture of our model, called SJ-MAE.

  🧠 <b>TL;DR</b> - SJ-MAE goes beyond individual self-supervised tasks by combining them into a single hybrid framework:
  <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
    <li><i>Complementary Objectives</i>: reconstruction captures local details, jigsaw captures spatial structure, and contrastive learning captures semantic similarity</li>
    <li><i>Joint Optimization</i>: balancing these objectives is crucial to ensure the model learns all aspects without one dominating</li>
    <li><i>Rich Representations</i>: by integrating multiple signals, SJ-MAE produces embeddings that generalize better across datasets and downstream tasks</li>
  </ul>
  This final approach demonstrates how thoughtfully combining multiple self-supervised strategies can push representation learning further than any single method alone.

# The Challenge of Hybrid Self-Supervision

By now, you’ve seen that self-supervised learning comes in many flavors: **contrastive learning** helps the model understand similarity, **masked reconstruction** teaches it to infer missing content, and **pretext tasks** like jigsaw focus on spatial reasoning.

But trying to make a model learn all these at once isn’t trivial. Each objective can pull the network in a different direction. Too much focus on one task might overshadow the others. Too little, and the model might fail to learn anything useful.

In essence, combining these objectives is like juggling three balls at the same time: it requires careful balance and coordination.

# How SJ-MAE Combines Multiple Objectives

Our goal with **SJ-MAE** was simple in concept but tricky in practice: let the model learn from **multiple signals simultaneously**, so it could capture richer, more general representations.

Here’s how we approached it:

### Masked Reconstruction (MAE branch)
The model sees an image with randomly masked patches. The encoder learns a compact representation, and the decoder tries to reconstruct the missing patches.
This teaches the network to **infer local details and context**, building a strong feature bottleneck.

### Jigsaw Puzzle (Jigsaw branch)
Randomly shuffling image patches, the model predicts their original positions.
This encourages understanding of **spatial relationships** and object structure — something reconstruction alone might not fully capture.

### Contrastive Learning (Siamese branch)
We generate augmented pairs of the same image and train the model to pull them together in embedding space while pushing other images apart.
This branch focuses on **semantic consistency**, making representations invariant to transformations like rotation, cropping, or color jitter.

> Each branch addresses a different type of visual understanding: **local detail**, **spatial structure**, and **semantic similarity**.

# Balancing the Objectives

We combined these losses into a single training objective:

- `w_J` and `w_S` are weights controlling the contribution of the jigsaw and contrastive branches.
- Adjusting these weights allows us to **balance local vs. global features** and **spatial vs. semantic reasoning**.
- Through experiments, we found that moderate values (e.g., `w_J = 10`) generally worked well across datasets.

# Intuition Behind SJ-MAE

Think of SJ-MAE as a student learning a new skill:

- One teacher gives it **pieces of a puzzle** to understand spatial relationships.
- Another teacher **hides parts of the picture** and asks the student to reconstruct them, teaching inference.
- A third teacher compares the student’s work to peers, encouraging **consistency and semantic understanding**.

By combining all three, the student learns not just the small details, but also the bigger picture — a representation that generalizes across tasks.

# Practical Results

On benchmarks like **CIFAR-100**, **Caltech-256**, and **Imagenette**, SJ-MAE consistently outperformed single-objective models:

- Representations captured both **fine-grained texture** and **high-level semantic concepts**.
- Linear probing showed higher classification accuracy than vanilla MAE or Jigsaw models alone.
- Ablations confirmed that each branch contributed meaningfully: removing any branch degraded performance.

# Closing Thoughts

SJ-MAE represents the culmination of this exploration into hybrid self-supervised learning. By integrating reconstruction, jigsaw, and contrastive learning, we’ve created a model that learns **richer, more generalizable visual representations** than any single approach alone.

Hybrid self-supervision is still an open field: balancing multiple objectives, extending them to other modalities, or adding new tasks remains an exciting challenge. But SJ-MAE demonstrates that combining complementary signals can lead to **substantially stronger representations**, and it’s a step forward for self-supervised vision foundation models.

> Thanks for following the series! I hope this journey into SJ-MAE has given you a clearer picture of the possibilities in self-supervised learning and the kind of design decisions that go into building these models.
